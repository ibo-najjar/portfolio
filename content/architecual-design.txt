# Intro to system modeling

the process of developing abstract models of a system with each model representing a different perspective of the system.

## System perspectives

1.  **External**: where you model the contxt or environment of the system.
2.  **Intercational**: model intercations between a system and its environment.
3.  **Structual**: model the organization of a system or the structure of the data that is processed by the system.
4.  **Behavioral**: model the dynamic behavior of a system (how the system responds to events).

## UML diagram types

1. **activity diagram**: which show the activities involved in a process or in data processing.
2. **Use case diagram**: a diagram that shows the interactions between the system and its environment.
3. **Sequence diagram**: a diagram that shows the interactions between actors and the system.
4. **Class diagram**: a diagram that shows the classes and their relationships.
5. **State diagram**: which show how the system reacts to internal and external events.

we use graphical diagrams as means of facilitating a discussion and to prove a point (diagram can be incomplete or wrong), or as a way of documenting a system (diagram can be incomplete but has to be correct), or as a detailed system description that can be used to generate a system implementation (diagram has to be complete and correct).
